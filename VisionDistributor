# Additional functionality and methods can be added as needed

# The `VisionDistributor` tool allows you to distribute a given vision model across multiple devices or nodes by adding them using the `add_device` method.
# Each device gets its own cloned model, and the forward pass can be performed on each device independently.
# The `forward` method aggregates the outputs from all devices and returns the aggregated output tensor.

# The `synchronize_models` method ensures that the model parameters are synchronized across all devices, allowing consistent behavior during training or inference.

# You can further enhance the `VisionDistributor` tool by adding additional methods for efficient data transfer between devices, handling gradients during training,
# or implementing custom synchronization strategies.
# This tool provides a unique approach to distributing vision models and can be a valuable addition to your multidistributed vision network repository.
