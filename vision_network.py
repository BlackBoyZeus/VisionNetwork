#n this analogy, the vision nodes represent individual workers that perform the computer vision operations on the images. They are created as separate processes using the multiprocessing module for parallel execution. The image_queue is a shared queue where the main program distributes the images to the vision nodes, and the result_queue is used to collect the processed images from the nodes.

#The process_image function represents a computer vision task, such as object detection or image segmentation, that is performed on each image by the vision nodes. In this example, it is a placeholder function that simply passes through the original image.

#Please note that this analogy is a simplified representation, and the actual design and implementation of distributed computer vision systems can be much more complex and sophisticated. However, this example showcases the idea of distributed processing and collaboration among nodes for computer vision tasks, drawing inspiration from the concepts of parallelism and task delegation in the Lightning Network.
