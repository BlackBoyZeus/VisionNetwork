# Additional utility functions and classes can be added as needed

# this example, the vision_utils.py file defines two utility functions: resize_image and normalize_image. These functions can be used to resize images to a specified size and normalize pixel values to the range [0, 1], respectively.

#Additionally, the file includes a helper class called ImageVisualizer that can be used for visualizing images and their associated labels. This class can provide methods for drawing bounding boxes, overlaying text, or any other visualization tasks specific to your computer vision application.
